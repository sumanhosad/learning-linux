### Web 3.0 
   - #### [Article ](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/)
- decentralized system - Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. 
- #### Web 1.0: Read-Only (1990-2004)
     - 'Web 1.0', occurred roughly between 1990 to 2004. Web 1.0 was mainly static websites owned by companies, and there was close to zero interaction between users - individuals seldom produced content - leading to it being known as the read-only web. 
	    
- #### Web  2.0: Read-Write (2004-now) 
     - The Web 2.0 period began in 2004 with the emergence of social media platforms. Instead of a read-only, the web evolved to be read-write. Instead of companies providing content to users, they also began to provide platforms to share user-generated content and engage in user-to-user interactions. As more people came online, a handful of top companies began to control a disproportionate amount of the traffic and value generated on the web. Web 2.0 also birthed the advertising-driven revenue model. While users could create content, they didn't own it or benefit from its monetization.
- #### Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own 
     - The premise of 'Web 3.0' was coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood shortly after Ethereum launched in 2014. Gavin put into words a solution for a problem that many early crypto adopters felt: the Web required too much trust. That is, most of the Web that people know and use today relies on trusting a handful of private companies to act in the public's best interests.


- #### Core  ideas of Web3 
     - Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
    - Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
    - Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
    - Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.
    
    - #### Ownership 
        - Web3 allows for direct ownership through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). No one, not even the game's creators, has the power to take away your ownership. And, if you stop playing, you can sell or trade your in-game items on open markets and recoup their value.
    - #### Censorship Resistance 
        - On Web3, your data lives on the blockchain. When you decide to leave a platform, you can take your reputation with you, plugging it into another interface that more clearly aligns with your values.
        - Web 2.0 requires content creators to trust platforms not to change the rules, but censorship resistance is a native feature of a Web3 platform.
    - #### entralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) 
        - As well as owning your data in Web3, you can own the platform as a collective, using tokens that act like shares in a company. DAOs let you coordinate decentralized ownership of a platform and make decisions about its future.
    - #### Identity 
        -  Web3 solves these problems by allowing you to control your digital identity with an Ethereum address and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) profile. Using an Ethereum address provides a single login across platforms that is secure, censorship-resistant, and anonymous. 
    - #### Native Payment 
        - Web2's payment infrastructure relies on banks and payment processors, excluding people without bank accounts or those who happen to live within the borders of the wrong country. Web3 uses tokens like ETH to send money directly in the browser and requires no trusted third party.
- #### Limitations of Web 3.0
    - ##### Accessibility 
        - Important Web3 features, like Sign-in with Ethereum, are already available for anyone to use at zero cost. But, the relative cost of transactions is still prohibitive to many. Web3 is less likely to be utilized in less-wealthy, developing nations due to high transaction fees. On Ethereum, these challenges are being solved through the roadmap and layer 2 scaling solutions. The technology is ready, but we need higher levels of adoption on layer 2 to make Web3 accessible to everyone. 
    - ###### User Experience 
        - The technical barrier to entry to using Web3 is currently too high. Users must comprehend security concerns, understand complex technical documentation, and navigate unintuitive user interfaces. [Wallet providers](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/), in particular, are working to solve this, but more progress is needed before Web3 gets adopted en masse.
    - ###### Education 
        - Web3 introduces new paradigms that require learning different mental models than the ones used in Web2.0. A similar education drive happened as Web1.0 was gaining popularity in the late 1990s; proponents of the world wide web used a slew of educational techniques to educate the public from simple metaphors (the information highway, browsers, surfing the web) to television broadcasts(opens in a new tab). Web3 isn't difficult, but it is different. Educational initiatives informing Web2 users of these Web3 paradigms are vital for its success.
        - Ethereum.org contributes to Web3 education through our Translation Program, aiming to translate important Ethereum content to as many languages as possible.
    - ###### Centralized Infrastructure
        - The Web3 ecosystem is young and quickly evolving. As a result, it currently depends mainly on centralized infrastructure (GitHub, Twitter, Discord, etc.). Many Web3 companies are rushing to fill these gaps, but building high-quality, reliable infrastructure takes time.
- ###### A Decentralized future 
    - Web3 is a young and evolving ecosystem. Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, but many of these ideas have only recently become a reality. In the last year alone, there has been a considerable surge in the interest in cryptocurrency, improvements to layer 2 scaling solutions, massive experiments with new forms of governance, and revolutions in digital identity.
    - We are only at the beginning of creating a better Web with Web3, but as we continue to improve the infrastructure that will support it, the future of the Web looks bright.
