- ### [[X3DH |X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman)]]: 
    - A key agreement protocol used for establishing a shared secret between two parties in an asynchronous environment. It's used to set up secure sessions between users.
- ### Double Ratchet Algorithm:
    - Provides end-to-end encryption for subsequent messages after the session has been established. It ensures that each message has a unique encryption key, enhancing security
- ### ECDH Key Exchange:
    - The ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange) is anonymous key agreement scheme, which allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. ECDH is very similar to the classical DHKE (Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange) algorithm, but it uses ECC point multiplication instead of modular exponentiations.
