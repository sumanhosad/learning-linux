Yes, the keys you've generated are consistent with the key types used in the X3DH protocol (which is part of the Signal Protocol). Here's an explanation of each key in the context of the X3DH protocol:

### 1. **Identity Private and Public Keys (IK - Identity Key)**
   - **Private Key A/B**: These are long-term private keys that are unique to each user. They are used to identify the user in the network. They do not change and are used across multiple sessions.
   - **Public Key A/B**: These are the corresponding public keys of the Identity Keys. They are shared with others so that they can be used to verify the identity of the user.
   - **Role**: The identity keys are crucial for identity verification. They are signed to authenticate other key pairs (like Signed Pre-Keys).

   **In the code:**
   - `Identity Private Key A`, `Identity Public Key A`
   - `Identity Private Key B`, `Identity Public Key B`

   **Explanation**: These keys are used to uniquely identify a user and are involved in the key exchange process. Public Identity Keys are shared with others, while private Identity Keys are kept secret.

---

### 2. **Signed Pre-Key (SPK)**
   - **Signed Pre-Key Private and Public Keys A/B**: These keys are medium-term keys. They are signed by the user's identity private key to authenticate them. The signed pre-key allows the recipient to confirm the origin of the public pre-key, ensuring the key exchange process is secure.
   - **Signed Pre-Key Signature A/B**: This signature is generated using the identity private key and is used to verify that the Signed Pre-Key actually belongs to the user. It provides authenticity and ensures that the public signed pre-key was generated by the person claiming to own it.

   **In the code:**
   - `Signed Pre-Key Private Key A`, `Signed Pre-Key Public Key A`, `Signed Pre-Key Signature A`
   - `Signed Pre-Key Private Key B`, `Signed Pre-Key Public Key B`, `Signed Pre-Key Signature B`

   **Explanation**: The signed pre-keys are used for mutual authentication and prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. The signature confirms that the pre-key was generated by the rightful owner.

---

### 3. **One-Time Pre-Key (OPK)**
   - **Private and Public Pre-Key A/B**: These are short-lived keys that are used once and discarded after use. They are generated for forward secrecy, ensuring that even if one session key is compromised, previous sessions cannot be decrypted. One-Time Pre-Keys are exchanged at the beginning of a session.
   
   **In the code:**
   - `Pre-Key Private Key A`, `Pre-Key Public Key A`
   - `Pre-Key Private Key B`, `Pre-Key Public Key B`

   **Explanation**: The One-Time Pre-Keys provide additional security by ensuring that each session has a unique set of keys, enhancing the protocol's forward secrecy. Each pre-key is used only once, and once used, they are discarded.

---

### 4. **Ephemeral Key (EK)**
   - **Ephemeral Private and Public Keys A/B**: These are temporary key pairs generated for each session and discarded afterward. They are typically used to establish a session-specific shared secret between two parties. The ephemeral keys add an extra layer of security, ensuring that each session has its own unique set of keys.
   
   **In the code:**
   - `Ephemeral Private Key A`, `Ephemeral Public Key A`
   - `Ephemeral Private Key B`, `Ephemeral Public Key B`

   **Explanation**: The ephemeral keys are generated fresh for every session. They are used to derive the shared secret between two parties (along with other keys, such as identity keys and pre-keys), and once the session ends, the ephemeral keys are discarded.

---

### Key Exchange Process in X3DH:

1. **User A**:
   - A generates its Identity Key (IK_A), Signed Pre-Key (SPK_A), and One-Time Pre-Key (OPK_A), then shares the public components: `IK_A`, `SPK_A`, and `OPK_A`.
   - A generates an Ephemeral Key (EK_A) for this session, which is used for the key exchange.
   
2. **User B**:
   - B generates its Identity Key (IK_B), Signed Pre-Key (SPK_B), and One-Time Pre-Key (OPK_B), then shares the public components: `IK_B`, `SPK_B`, and `OPK_B`.
   - B also generates an Ephemeral Key (EK_B) for this session.
   
3. **Key Exchange**:
   - Both users use a combination of their own identity key, signed pre-key, one-time pre-key, and the other user's public keys to perform Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.
   - The shared secret is derived from these exchanges and is used to create encryption keys for secure communication.
   - Ephemeral keys are used for deriving the session-specific key material, ensuring that each session is encrypted with fresh, unique keys.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the keys you've generated are sufficient for implementing the Signal Protocol (specifically the X3DH protocol). You have:
- Identity keys for authentication.
- Signed pre-keys for proof of ownership.
- One-time pre-keys for forward secrecy.
- Ephemeral keys for session-specific encryption.

Each of these key types plays a crucial role in providing security, privacy, and forward secrecy in the Signal Protocol's key exchange process.
